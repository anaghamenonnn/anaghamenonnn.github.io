        <p1 style="text-align:center;"> Seeing is fundamental. But it's not only for looking out it is for placing oneself in relation to what one sees. Both physically and metaphorically. Seeing is not a neutral thing but always a way of seeing. What we see and how we see it is mediated by culture and in some cases that culture has an agenda which may obstruct, and obfuscate the plain meaning of these images. This is meant to make people see things in a different way from what is meant or to hide the original meaning. Oil Painting is an example which Berger brings up. He calls this Mystification.</p1>
            <blockquote style="text-align:center;"> 'We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves.' </blockquote>
        <p> Women and men are perceived differently in society and in art and oil painting in the western tradition this difference is clear. A man’s presence depends on the promise of power which he embodies. A woman’s presence expresses her attitude towards herself, and defines what can and cannot be done to her. To be born a woman was been to be born, within an allotted and confined space, into the keeping of men.</p>
        <blockquote styles="text-align:center;"> "One might simplify this by saying: men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object — and most particularly an object of vision: a sight." </blockquote>
